    Recently I started learning Go, and my first exercise forced me to setup 
    a debugger, revisit a common issue, and learn some of the tooling ecosystem
    for Go.
---

Working on gophercises, naturally I started with the first problem. I needed to read in this CSV
and for each line (a) ask a question, (b) read in an answer, (c) record if it's correct, (d) keep 
track of the score across all questions.

This should be a good problem for learning some basics of the language.

{`5+5,10

## First Issue: A string comparison doesn't work?

This (seemingly simple) string comparison didn't seem to work. But, why? 

We're creating a new reader to parse CLI input. And even removing the included `\n` character which 
is read in from the user input. So, why wasn't this simple comparison working?? (Keep this EOL 
character in mind. It will come back at the end of the article.)

<MyHighlighter language="golang">
{`inputReader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
input, err := inputReader.ReadString('\\n')
if strings.Compare(input, records[i][1]) == 0 { // <- This is what was failing!
    fmt.Println("CORRECT!")
} else {
    fmt.Println("WRONG!")
}`}
</MyHighlighter>

_So, we need to debug!_

## Delve, a debugger

Ref: [https://www.rookout.com/blog/golang-debugging-tutorial/](https://www.rookout.com/blog/golang-debugging-tutorial/)

So, we need a debugger to inspect literal values...so we can see what trickery is at play.

The link above points me at [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve). This is a debugger for Go. 
But not so fast. Installing it only gives you a CLI debugger. Meaning you _technically_ have a full 
debugger, but it's only available from the terminal. We really need this available from within VSCode.

Either way, _install it like so._

<MyHighlighter language="golang">
{`go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest`}
</MyHighlighter>

## Configuring Delve + VSCode

This is the default `launch.json` we're given. _**But it's wrong!**_

Trying to debug with this configuration gets us this weird error.

### Solvin the 'tty' issue

According to this GitHub issue, it happens because ["VSCode's DEBUG CONSOLE does not have tty"](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2053#issuecomment-1031635355). That issue then refers us to the [`console` property](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#configuration) for the VSCode `launch.json` 
debugger configuration.

[ insert a screenshot of the GitHub issue ]

We need to set `integratedTerminal` for console. The default for `console` is `internalConsole`. So, be careful to make this change as _it is what forces our debug session to open in the VSCode's "Terminal" instead of the "Debug Console".

Ref, GitHub issue: [https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2053#issuecomment-1031635355](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2053#issuecomment-1031635355)
Ref, launch.json `console`: [https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#configuration](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#configuration)


### Solving the folder issue

Then, because for some reason the default config is looking the wrong directory (it's not able to find our `.go` code), we need to set `program` to the workspace VSCode is looking at.

<MyHighlighter language="json">
{`"program": "\$\{workspaceFolder\}"`}
</MyHighlighter>


Skip to the correct `launch.json`

<MyHighlighter language="json">
{`\{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch Package",
            "type": "go",
            "request": "launch",
            "mode": "auto",
            "program": "\$\{workspaceFolder\}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        }
    ]
\}\
`}
</MyHighlighter>

## The EOL character

Then I saw that, because I already had some code to remove `\n` (assumed newline char), I still had an `\r` 
in my `input` variable. This little mixup is because I'm running this code on Windows, and the [tutorial](https://tutorialedge.net/golang/reading-console-input-golang/) I 
was following was written for Linux.

[ insert screenshot of seeing this value in input ]

So, it's the right thought, but we have to be aware that Windows and Linux systems use [different EOL characters](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~krueger/csc209h/tut/line-endings.html).
