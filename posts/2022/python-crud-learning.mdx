## Intro

In thinking about my strategy for pulling data from database to client, I came across these 
two articles. They highlighted a couple key issues for me.

- [Multi-table filters in SQLAlchemy](https://medium.com/shoprunner/multi-table-filters-in-sqlalchemy-d64e2166199f)
- [Speed up with eager loading in SQLAlchemy](https://engineering.shopspring.com/speed-up-with-eager-loading-in-sqlalchemy-87a176cfd7ad)

Problems:

- **Joins in SQLAlchemy** -> I needed to query data across tables regularly
- **N+1 Problem** -> Querying for some common pages could produce dozens of DB calls, or complex client logic
- **Dynamic Data Transformations** -> Joined row-based data from SQL requires transformation into nested JSON-like models


## Apparent Query Differences

Apparently, we can replace a whole model declaration with field references, and it produces
more direct SQL in the ORM-produced query.

<MyHighlighter language="python">
{`res = db.query(Budget).join(Category).filter(
    Budget.id == Category.budget_id) #.all()
    return res`}
</MyHighlighter>

This only puts all of the Budget fields in the select clause!

<MyHighlighter language="python">
{`res = db.query(Budget.name, Category.name).join(Category).filter(
        Budget.id == Category.budget_id) #.all()
print(res)
return res`}
</MyHighlighter>

<MyHighlighter language="sql">
{`
SELECT budget.name AS budget_name, category.name AS category_name   
FROM budget JOIN category ON budget.id = category.budget_id
WHERE budget.id = category.budget_id
`}
</MyHighlighter>


## SQLAlchemy Relationships Declarative vs. Explicit Schemas

# A Problem -- How to Handle Joins, Mapping Related Data to Nested Models

This is going from the _relational SQL data_ to the nested, document-structure of JSON. For,
the resulting data models being sent to the client.

[insert (relational data pic) -> (nested data pic)]


Essentially, this boils down to "How do we move data from SQLAlchemy models to Pydantic models?"
And it appears Pydantic's ORM Mode solves the issue, _however_ I couldn't get this working with 
nested Pydantic models. Also, this transformation needs to work with potentially _sparse_ models. 
We don't want to be forced to always return full data models to the client, when much less data 
is needed for the desired page/component.

Many others have had this problem

I also tossed around the idea of moving to a completely different modeling library: [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/features/)

It looks like a clever layer on top of Pydantic and SQLAlchemy, but I was already 
learning enough with tutorials & docs made specific to Pydantic and SQLAlchemy. So, 
I'm steering clear of potentially getting stuck juggling libraries.

## Problem Queries - Joins

For any query only touching a single table, the SQLAlchemy + Pydantic + FastAPI combination is 
pretty slick. Needing to _nearly_ duplicate models for Pydantic and SQLAlchemy is questionable,
but the rest works pretty well.

However, joins are different. At least, they were in my experience. First, let's look at an 
example query.

**Example Query**

<MyHighlighter language="python">
{` 
db.query(
    Budget, Category
    ).join(Category).filter(Budget.id == Category.budget_id).first()
`}
</MyHighlighter>


The first problem I encountered was not being sure how to write a join via the ORM. If we have 
`.join()` it seems there would be an `.on()`, but no...we use `.filter()` instead. But remember
how we mentioned we could specify fields in our query instead of the whole model, and some of 
those ORM and Pydantic models were troublesome? Through a series of bugs I found I needed the 
query to be re-written something like the following:

<MyHighlighter language="python">
{`db.query(
    Budget.id,
    Budget.name,
    Category.id,
    Category.budget_id
    ).join(Category).filter(Budget.id == Category.budget_id).first()`}
</MyHighlighter>

Now, this is wonderful. I'm able to specify the columns I need in SQL to match the fields I need 
to fulfill in my models. Also (not discussed here) but in the client view this data will 
eventually be displayed in, we need to show a realtionship between the `Budget` and `Category`
model data. So, that `Category.budget_id` is important.

But the column names aren't returned directly in our resulting dataset. Presumably, only the 
values are. 




## Adding the label() to columns

Ref: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9187530/using-alias-for-select-as-in-sqlalchemy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9187530/using-alias-for-select-as-in-sqlalchemy)


## Accessing Column names, and Handling RMKeyView - single row

Ref: [Google Search - "python rmkeyview"](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=pythom+rmkeyview)

<MyHighlighter language="bash">
{`Found column names are accessible in \`res.keys()\`. This is RMKeyView`}
</MyHighlighter>

When querying a single row from SQLAlchemy (notice the `.first()`), we receive, well...a single 
row. However, that row does not come with columns defined. This is something I struggled with, 
but eventually found a messy solution via several StackOverflow pages. 

_Note: There is likely a cleaner way to do this. I couldn't find it...So, gave up and resolved 
to ripping data out of the results manually. Please tell me there is a better way to do this._

**Example Query**

<MyHighlighter language="python">
{`res = db.query(
    Budget.id.label('budget_id'),
    Budget.date_created.label('budget_date_created'),
    Budget.name.label('budget_name'),
    Category.id.label('category_id'),
    Category.date_created.label('category_date_created'),
    Category.name.label('category_name'),
    Category.budget_id.label('category_budget_id')
).join(Category).filter(Budget.id == Category.budget_id).first()`}
</MyHighlighter>

This query returns a `sqlalchemy.engine.row.Row` type, and it's indexible. So, accessing our data 
is pretty straightforward with an index, `res[0]`

<MyHighlighter language="python">
{`
res[0] -> UUID('some-data-here')
`}
</MyHighlighter>

But to access column names, we have to use `res.keys()`. Here's the problem. `res.keys()` returns an 
`RMKeyView` type, containing our column names, and _it isn't indexable_, but we can iterate over it.

<MyHighlighter language="python">
{`
for key in res.keys():
    print(key)
`}
</MyHighlighter>

Also, we're using `.label('column name')` on the column selections in our query, to provide a 
custom name for each column. Without this, the `key` is the same as the column name in 
the database. Nomrally this is fine, however it would be difficult to keep track of the differing 
`Budget.id` and `Category.id` columns, so providing column aliases is necessary.

So, an ugly bit of code, but this is how I was able to manually align the query result data with 
the column values, and then transform to our models.

<MyHighlighter language="python">
{`
res = db.query(
    # query removed for brevity
).first()
keys = [] # setup a list to hold column names
    for key in res.keys():
        keys.append(key) # append each key (i.e. column name) to our new list
mydata = {}                 # setup a dictionary for our column:data, key-value store
i = 0                       # an index counter
# This loop assumes there is an equal number of keys, and number of data values returned
while i < len(keys):            # iterate over our keys list (the new one)
    mydata[keys[i]] = res[i]    # each index of keys[] will be the key of mydata, and the value is pulled from res[i]
    i += 1                      # increment counter
`}
</MyHighlighter>

## Accessing Column names, and Handling RMKeyView - multiple rows

Ref: [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy_orm_working_with_joins.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy_orm_working_with_joins.htm)
But I actually needed to join several tables together, not just `Budget` and `Category`, and 
using this same `join() + filter()` broke when repeating it for several tables, but I didn't 
really understand why.

Instead, we can use an _explicit condition_ for the join. Notice the `.filter()` use goes away.

<MyHighlighter language="python">
{`res = db.query(
        Budget.id.label('budget_id'),
        \# -- more field definitions go here --
        Envelope.id.label('envelope_id'),
        Transaction.id.label('transaction_id')
    ).join(Category, Budget.id == Category.budget_id
    ).join(Envelope, Category.id == Envelope.category_id
    ).join(Transaction, Envelope.id == Transaction.envelope_id).all()
for row in res:
    print(row) \# See the RMKeyView, row here
    print(row.keys()) \# See the keys (column names) for the row here`}
</MyHighlighter>


However, an `.all()` query is _a series of rows_. So, we need to alter our 
data transformation to handle multiple rows.

### Example Code

<MyHighlighter language="python">
{`result = db.query(
    # -- the same field definitions; removed for brevity
).join(Category).filter(Budget.id == Category.budget_id).all()
# NOTE: this time result is a set of rows
keys = [] # setup a list to hold column names
for key in result[0].keys(): # Get keys from the first row in our result set
    keys.append(key)
mydata = [] # This time we have a list to hold multiple objects
for row in result:
    i = 0
    myobj = {}
    while i < len(keys): # this loop translates each row
        myobj[keys[i]] = row[i]
        i += 1
    mydata.append(myobj) # put our translated object in our new collection
# Then iterate over our new collection to create our objects
for data in mydata:
    b = Budget(
        id = data['budget_id']
        date_created = data['date_created']
        # so on...
        category = Category(
            id = data['category_id']
            date_created = data['category_date_created']
        )
    )`}
</MyHighlighter>
