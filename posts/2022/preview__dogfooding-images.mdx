    Taking a closer look at what process I follow to add images (and other content) to the site. And 
    (potentially) finding ways to make it better.

While pulling together the [Pedernales Falls hiking](/link-goes-here) post, I realized my process for 
creating and adding images (or really any content) to the site needed to change.

Process to create content for website:

- Capture
- Ingest and review
- (opt.) Edit
- Convert to compressed web formats
- Upload to CMS (AWS S3)
- Link to page


## Convert to Compressed Web Format(s)

We have this really cool utility, `cwebp`. It works great. It's distributed as a binary for x86, and 
seemingly limited to running on a local PC.

Bummer.

### Other Notes

- On PC: Bulk-renaming would be nice -- _Is there a utility for this?_
- On PC: Do we have a naming convention for tracking image files?
- Be aware: original, orig. quality w/ smaller pixel size, smaller pixel size w/ compressed (webp), 
thumbnail, blur thumbnail?
- How do we bulk compress using `cwebp`?
