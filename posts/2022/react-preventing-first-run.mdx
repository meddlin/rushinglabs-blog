    It feels like every time I step away from React and come back something has 
    changed. This time it was useEffect. This turns into a walk through learning how an old 
    data fetching habit led me to see a design flaw and reflect on error messages
    and documentation.

It feels like every time I step away from React and come back something has 
changed. This time it was `useEffect`.

So, my issue was throwing a pretty pedestrian `fetch()` inside of `useEffect()`
to automatically load data upon first load for a component. _I could've sworn 
this was a pattern I had used in the past._ But somehow now my `useEffect` 
logic seems to be executing twice. _**Am I forgetting something?!**_

_Not exactly as Dan Abramov explained 
[here](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/24502#issuecomment-1118867879)_, 
and if you want the `tl;dr` check out this article by [Zachary Lee](https://blog.bitsrc.io/react-v18-0-useeffect-bug-why-do-effects-run-twice-39babecede93). 
He explains it well.

## The Issue

We'll cover the issue with my code in-depth below, but the short answer is: 
`useEffect()` now executes twice _because_ React 18 mounts, unmounts, and 
remounts components by default, when running in development mode with 
`React.StrictMode` enabled. This is to help developers highlight potential 
issues with component state logic earlier in development.

So, my issue with this isn't that "React changed"...but that this behavior is 
removed from the context of _**why**_ it exists. _If a possibly unexpected behavior 
is going to be running by default to help prevent errors, **specifically in 
development under Strict Mode**, then shuoldn't a warning also pop by default?_

Perhaps I'm blind, or just not smart enough to know where in the [docs to start 
reading at](https://beta-reactjs-org-git-effects-fbopensource.vercel.app/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#step-3-add-cleanup-if-needed). 
But this experience with React is something I've experienced several 
times, and in the past I always just chalked it up to not being in the ecosystem 
daily or some type of "JavaScript fatigue". 

**But!** but...this felt different. I thought I had legitimately made an 
error&mdash;not, encountered a _**different behavior**_ of _**equivalent code**_. So, 
instead of immediately going to Read-The-Free-Manual, I started 
down the road of Googling to find articles, etc. hoping to find where others explained how 
they fixed this _seemingly elementary stumbling block I had forgotten._


## Discovering, Getting back to the docs

No, instead I found a random (but fortunate) [blog article](https://blog.bitsrc.io/react-v18-0-useeffect-bug-why-do-effects-run-twice-39babecede93)
that pointed me back to the section of the updated docs, I didn't know was 
going to be worth reviewing.

### Article -> GH issue

In this article, I see Zachary explaining how he stumbled through the double-call, 
and where he found Dan Abramov explaining it all in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/24502#issuecomment-1118867879)

Ah. So, we're [ensuring reusable state](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#ensuring-reusable-state). 
Well, that's certainly a good thing, but that's a weird place to mention it. 🤷‍♂ 

### GH Issue -> Reddit reply

Now, reading Dan Abramov's full reply on the GitHub issue, he references a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/vi6q6f/comment/iddrjue/).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/vi6q6f/comment/iddrjue/](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/vi6q6f/comment/iddrjue/)

The Reddit post is exceptionally thorough, referencing other blog posts, the new 
React docs beta, and he even provides some explanation for an attempt to consolidate 
the docs. (Kind of my point. Very thankful it's being addressed! 👍) It's definitely 
worth a full read if you're working this fetch/useEffect issue.

### Article -> React Docs (BETA)

At the end of Zachary's blog article, and also in Dan's Reddit reply we get references 
to the new [React Docs Beta](https://beta-reactjs-org-git-effects-fbopensource.vercel.app/): [https://beta-reactjs-org-git-effects-fbopensource.vercel.app/learn/synchronizing-with-effects](https://beta-reactjs-org-git-effects-fbopensource.vercel.app/learn/synchronizing-with-effects)

Again...AWESOME! but holy cow we had to dig for this...

The whole [Synchronizing with Effects](https://beta-reactjs-org-git-effects-fbopensource.vercel.app/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) 
is worth the read. However...

### This is the part I needed

Skipping down to "Step 3: Add cleanup if needed", in this page of the React Docs Beta, 
they begin walking through the `useEffect()` issue. It uses a hypothetical ChatRoom application 
as the backdrop to explain this change surrounding `useEffect`.





## Skip to the Code

_All that to just use the same old `fetch()` from `useEffect()` with a flag check?!_

Yes. I'm writing a simple app. All I need is a "grab from database" upon component 
load. It's all local development, so I can handle round trips without a caching 
layer. And forcing this "flag" condition in the `useEffect` allows me to avoid 
loading secondary libraries like React Query or `useSWR`, while sticking to typical 
React-style code, and getting the proof-of-concept done. I'll handle those issues later when 
I get to them.

But now we understand ___why___.


Exmaple code: I found [another article](https://typeofnan.dev/how-to-prevent-useeffect-from-running-on-mount-in-react/) 
explaining how to use `useRef` to avoid fetching if it's the first load for the component.

<MyHighlighter language="javascript">
{`import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'
export default MyComponent() {
    const isMounted = useRef(false);
    const [storage, setStorage] = useState({})
    useEffect(() => {
        if (isMounted.current) {
            fetch(url, {
                headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Accept': 'application/json' },
            })
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => setStorage(data))
        } else {
            isMounted.current = true;
        }
    }, [])
    return (
        <>
            <h2>My Component</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Storage contains: {storage}</p>
            </div>
        </>
    )
}`}
</MyHighlighter>

From the React Docs Beta, they [achieve this slightly differently (Fetching data)](https://typeofnan.dev/how-to-prevent-useeffect-from-running-on-mount-in-react/).

- The React Docs version produces two network requests, but the first gets ignored.
- The `useRef` version avoids the secondary network request, but notice the `useRef` flag is scoped 
to the component, not only the `useEffect()` call. 

<MyHighlighter language="javascript">
{`
useEffect(() => {
  let ignore = false;
  async function startFetching() {
    const json = await fetchTodos(userId);
    if (!ignore) {
      setTodos(json);
    }
  }
  startFetching();
  return () => {
    ignore = true;
  };
}, [userId]);
`}
</MyHighlighter>
