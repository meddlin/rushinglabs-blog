    Wow!...GitHub has a lot of tools for managing repos!
---

It never seems to fail. When I have an idea for a new project that makes it's way to actually writing 
some code, and then creating a repo...and then it sparks off other ideas...

I start trying to track it all somehow.

Somewhere along the way I came across GitHub's project planning features. In case you weren't 
aware, this feature was introduced a while back. While it's great to have everything in one 
place, I found it all...a little coarse. Then I forced myself to spend some time with it tracking 
issues for my [website project](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog/issues). 

And, with a few tweaks, _it started to click_. Let's walk through the pieces.


## Repo

This is where your code lives. That's it, but we gotta cover it.


## Issues

Tracking _stuff to do_ AND _stuff that's wrong_

"an issue to be addressed, not necessarily an issue to be resolved"...if that makes sense.

When I first learned git it was lost on me why _everything seemed to be an issue_. If we're 
handling "issues", shouldn't there also be 


## Projects

Projects was introduced to GitHub a while back. And for a while I found it...a little coarse.
Maybe? But then I forced myself to spend 
some time with it. The issues I was tracking for my [website project](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog/issues) 
were getting a little 
tough to hold all together, so I forced myself to sit with GitHub's projects solution. 
After all, managing all of this in one space is absolutely better than trekking across multiple 
apps.

### Milestones

Milestones are the major goals to hit along the way...y'know, _milestones_.

Milestones can be found on the Issues page

    width="1340"
    height="381"
    layout="responsive"
    alt="Milestones can be found on GitHub issues page"
/>

Then click "New Milestone" to create a new one

    width="1352"
    height="362"
    layout="responsive"
    alt="Issues, then Milestones, then New Milestone"
/>


I like to think of these as checkpoints along your "path of progress". I like to break 
these down into v1.0, v1.5 as my milestones. And then assign the issues to those milestones that 
I think should go into that version, or make sense to go together. Sometimes it's "do these 
issues/features belong together?" and other times it's more timeline driven like, "what can 
I get done by X date?"



### Category (custom field)

I found that some of my issues could all be grouped into a certain type. For this particular project, in my big 
list of issues there several that seemed to be about a `Consistent UI`: [Choosing a CSS solution](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog/issues/95), 
[Adding dark mode](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog/issues/63). That sort of thing.

Others were all about `Showcasing Content` or code quality things like `Site Architecture`.

I try to think of these as a "type of issue", or...a "_category_". Take a look at the default labels.
If these are making sense for your project, then maybe don't consider this custom field.

_However!_ consider if you have, say...10 issues...which all have the same label(s), then isn't 
that becoming a natual "grouping" of those issues? Kind of like a category.

Status 

- Just plain, good-to-have: todo, in progress, and done. Feel free to add more as necessary.

### Fields I Use

- Status
- Milestones
- Category


## Projects: Customizing the views 

You can create varied "views" of the same project data, store them to view the project from different 
perspectives, and even rename the views accordingly!

    layout="responsive"
    alt="GitHub projects table view. All issues displayed in a table."
/>
