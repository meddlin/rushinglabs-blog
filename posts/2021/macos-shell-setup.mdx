    So...I just made the switch to an M1 MacBook Air. Like many others. And it's been about 6 years since I last personally used a Mac. So, I started my reintroduction to Mac OS and getting acquainted with my shiny new laptop. However, I've never needed to configure any terminal application. The default functionality has always been enough to get my work done. Trying to use Node.js on M1--and running into a need for zsh--has changed that for me.

So...I just made the switch to an M1 MacBook Air. _Like many others._ And it's been about 6 years since I last personally used a Mac. So, I started my reintroduction to Mac OS and getting acquainted with my shiny new laptop.

However, I've never needed to configure any terminal application. The default functionality has always been enough to get my work done. Trying to use Node.js on M1--and running into a need for zsh--has changed that for me.

So, I'm hoping to share a little about that experience here.


## Bombarded: Drowning in Tools

As I said, it's been a while since my last foray with Mac OS, so I figured a quick Google search was in order before installing random tools and possibly mucking up my environment. 

_I was wrong._

Immediately, I ran into dozens of recommendations for varying combinations of: homebrew, iTerm2, zsh (as opposed to bash?), OhMyZsh, _and of course_ nvm (for managing `npm`).

**_Cue flashbacks to the explosion of JS tools in 2015 web development._**


## Shortest path to running `npm`?

- Answer: which shell am I running?
- zsh (default) -> may as well install OhMyZsh then
- reload terminal, install `nvm`


### What's my shell, again?

_(yes, a Blink182 reference)_

Ref: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43417162/which-shell-i-am-using-in-mac](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43417162/which-shell-i-am-using-in-mac)

Of course, StackOverflow has the answer. Short answer is, `zsh` is likely your default. To verify, you can check from Terminal's menubar by Terminal -> Preferences -> General, or running the following:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="bash">
{`
# for currently running
ps -o comm= $$
# for default
echo $SHELL
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>


### False Start, need a profile

After determining my shell, I then attempted to install `nvm` (to better manage `npm`).

<SyntaxHighlighter language="bash">
{`
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

However, this is where I received an error stating I didn't have a shell profile available.

[ *NOTE: Insert pic of error message showing missing profile configs* ]

- `~/.bashrc`
- `~/.bash_profile`
- `~/.zshrc`
- `~/.profile`

### Oh My Zsh

So, at this point I've determined I'm using `zsh` and tools are telling me I need a profile. I may as well start using Oh My Zsh since I need a profile (`~/.zshrc`) and it's built for managing exactly that.

To install "Oh My Zsh":

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Works Now

Recap; I'm using zsh, install Oh My Zsh, and restarted the terminal now. So any PATH variables changes have been loaded into the current session.

Let's install `nvm` again, and it works this time!

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash
```

Then we can install `npm`. Just note, this command will take a few minutes to run. From what I've read elsewhere nvm is compiling npm from source.

```bash
nvm install v15
```
