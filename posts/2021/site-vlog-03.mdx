## TikTok link & Readme.md

[PR #34](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog-nextjs/pull/34) / [PR #44](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog-nextjs/pull/44)

**TikTok** &mdash; Feels a little weird to write about adding a link, but it was the right time to bring TikTok to 
the About page. Good things are happening over there. &mdash; [@rushinglabs](https://www.tiktok.com/@rushinglabs?lang=en)

**Readme** &mdash; I hope I can remember to continue keeping the [README](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog-nextjs#readme) 
updated. Not much to say here; _it's all [over there](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog-nextjs#readme)_ 😅

## Blog preview

[PR #55](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog-nextjs/pull/55)

I wanted to be able to show a preview of the post's content directly inline with the list of blog posts. This is 
commonly done on blogs, but I just hadn't taken the time to finish this feature. A slight quirk though,
I am using [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) to parse the frontmatter metadata packaged 
with each post. _Which means this frontmatter is a block of YAML._

I quickly figured out that line breaks aren't valid in YAML properties by themselves. However, with a little 
bit of special syntax (see the `|-` next to `preview`) the line breaks are completely fine. This 
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3790454/how-do-i-break-a-string-in-yaml-over-multiple-lines/21699210) 
post has a good reference for multi-line YAML:

In addition to this "preview", there's also a new "Read More" link below the preview for each post. This is the 
same link that the post title has, but it felt like it made sense to include a call to action here.

## Code QL

[PR #41](https://github.com/meddlin/rushinglabs-blog-nextjs/pull/41)

Code QL &mdash; [https://codeql.github.com/](https://codeql.github.com/)

Code QL is a free SAST tool from GitHub, and available to integrate directly within your repo(s). I 
haven't started to dive into it yet, but I made sure to incorporate it into the site so it's there. Integrating it 
is easy too, just head to the "Security" tab on your GitHub repo, click "Set up this workflow", and the commit 
is already written for you.

The Code QL workflow runs automatically on every pull request, although depending on what language and how much 
code, it could take some time to complete the scan.

_Expect to see more of this in later posts_ 😊
