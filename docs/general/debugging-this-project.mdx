This page was also helpful. It's basically the same as Vercel's docs, but showed me I wasn't missing 
anything obvious.

From Vercel's docs for debugging Next.js, add the following code to a `launch.json`

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Next.js: debug server-side",
      "type": "node-terminal",
      "request": "launch",
      "command": "npm run dev"
    },
    {
      "name": "Next.js: debug client-side",
      "type": "pwa-chrome",
      "request": "launch",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000"
    },
    {
      "name": "Next.js: debug full stack",
      "type": "node-terminal",
      "request": "launch",
      "command": "npm run dev",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "serverReadyAction": {
        "pattern": "started server on .+, url: (https?://.+)",
        "uriFormat": "%s",
        "action": "debugWithChrome"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Script config difference

You may think it necessary to update the `scripts` section of your `package.json`, to reflect 
a debug step _and then_ point the `launch.json` server-side config at this debug command. However, 
this was a weird point for me...that didn't work.

In [Server-side code section](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/debugging#server-side-code) 
of the Vercel docs, they mention adding the `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect'` to the startup script, but 
leaving this off worked better for me.


## Weird hooking-in, startup behavrior

Set breakpoints in `getStaticProps()` for a page, and any downstream functions that need debugging.

- Without setting an initial breakpoint in `getStaticProps`, I wasn't always able to get downstream 
breakpoints to fire.
- Often it was necessary to skip past (F5) some "built JavaScript noise", for the debugger to properly 
setup, then a page refresh was possible, _and then_ the set breakpoints would hit.
