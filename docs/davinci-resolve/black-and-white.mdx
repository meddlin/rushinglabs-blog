Ref: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wD-VxbW8Gg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wD-VxbW8Gg)

- Select the clip
- Navigate to Color page
- Click monochrome tab

Note: _Be mindful that in multiple layers of video, each layer of video above the desired clip 
to make monochrom, needs to be disabled. Or at least that's what seemed to work last time._
