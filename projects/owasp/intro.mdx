title: 'Intro: Why Bother "Explaning" the Top 10?'

    Why do this? Because vulns, code, proactive defenses, and an explanation to
    wrap it all up needs to be connected.

OWASP's reporting on the Top 10 vulnerabilities for software applications is a great 
piece. However, it's written for a large audience: governance-writers, policy-makers,
...oh, and _developers_. So it's wonderful information, but requires a little more 
to see how it applies to making our code secure.

I'll do my best to start with definitions and recommendations straight from OWASP, 
and then expand with code samples.

## The Overlap of OWASP Top 10 Guidance

A cool little note, OWASP also publishes a lits of proactive controls for how to defend 
against the "Top 10" vulnerabilities. It's important to note though, the top 10 vulns 
and controls _do not line up one-to-one_. So this sense of overlap begins to surface, 
and I'll try to cover that as well.

Technically speaking, if we’re defining vulnerability categories by CWE then there is no 
overlap. However, for conceptual understanding of how these things operate practically, 
the “overlap” is helpful to visualize.

This distinction helps explain why the “top 10” and the proactive controls do not line 
up one-to-one.
